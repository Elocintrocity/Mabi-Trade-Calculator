Oh uh, hi. I literally just made this because the old Mabi calculator was outdated (didn't have Iria towns) and the wiki is fine, but doesn't let you do comparisons easily. I'd just find myself screenshotting each calculation I did on the wiki. So I cobbled this together so I'd have something that had all the features I want. 

Uhhhh, enjoy hopefully?

Some things to note:
- I've never reached Silver 5 before, so I have ZERO clue how bartering works in Mabi, nor do I know how I'd implement it.
- It only compares one destination town at a time, it doesn't compare like, different towns. I might look into implementing that sometime, but, it's pretty obvious which town is the most profitable compared to the others just by looking at them, so it seems like a moot point. I did JUST add in the ability to prompt for another trade, though. If there were a way to compare profitiability based on time it generally takes for a route, that'd be really neat. But I'd need to make quite a few runs for an average time, and then, some people probably have WAY faster commerce stuff than I do, so, again, moot point.
